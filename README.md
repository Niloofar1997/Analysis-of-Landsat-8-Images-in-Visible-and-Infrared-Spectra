# Analysis-of-Landsat-8-Images-in-Visible-and-Infrared-Spectra

Overview

Landsat-8 is a satellite of the Landsat series dedicated to the Earth observation. It carries two instruments on board that act as a camera sensor to detect and process incoming light from the Earth. The two sensors called OLI and TIRS operate in visible and infrared parts of electromagnetic spectrum. Since every element on the Earthâ€™s surface and in the atmosphere reflects and emits radiation in its individual wavelength, it is possible to distinguish between the elements by taking image in different wavelength bands. Landsat-8 is able to produce images in 11 bands and this performance domain provides scientists better understanding of the progress and loss of every element such as vegetation, water and so on. Here, the city Hamburg, Germany, and its surroundings are analyzed so that the features are well is inguished by analysis of greyscale image, histogram, false color image, cluster classification and scatter plot.
